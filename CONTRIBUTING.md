## Cookbook Structure

The `cookbooks/` directory is organized by **model generation → tower → capability**. Each cookbook is a self-contained directory with a README, one or more runnable notebooks, and supporting assets.

```
cookbooks/
└── cosmos3/
    ├── README.md                          # Shared setup (all backends)
    ├── cosmos3-model-architecture.png

### Where Does My Cookbook Go?

| Your cookbook does... | Place it under |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Image/video understanding, VLM, reasoning, grounding | `cookbooks/cosmos3/reasoner/` |
| Text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, audio | `cookbooks/cosmos3/generator/audiovisual/` |
| Robotics policy, forward/inverse dynamics | `cookbooks/cosmos3/generator/action/` |
| Video-to-video style transfer, edge-guided generation | `cookbooks/cosmos3/generator/transfer/` |

If your cookbook spans multiple towers (e.g., Reasoner analysis → Generator synthesis), create a new directory under `cookbooks/cosmos3/` with a clear name (e.g., `cookbooks/cosmos3/end2end/`).

## Cookbook Quality Requirements

Every cookbook merged into this repo must meet these requirements. Reviewers will check each item.

### 1. Open-Access Data Only

- All datasets must be **publicly downloadable** without NVIDIA-internal credentials
- Acceptable sources: HuggingFace Hub (public or gated with free access), public URLs, synthetic data generated in the notebook
- If working with partners, request a **small public subset** for the cookbook example
- Include the dataset license in your README

**Not acceptable:** Internal S3 buckets, VPN-only URLs, private NFS mounts, datasets requiring paid partner agreements

### 2. Results / Expected Output

Every cookbook must include a **Results** section showing what a successful run looks like:

- **Inference cookbooks:** Sample generated images/videos, text outputs, or action trajectories saved to `assets/`
- **Post-training cookbooks:** Training loss curves, before/after comparison, evaluation metrics
- **Timing benchmarks:** Wall-clock time on the target GPU (e.g., "Cosmos3-Nano T2V: 45s on 1× A100")

This lets developers validate their own runs against a known-good baseline.

### 3. Canonical Setup (No Hidden Dependencies)

- **Do not duplicate setup instructions.** Link to the shared [`cookbooks/cosmos3/README.md`](cookbooks/cosmos3/README.md) for backend installation (Cosmos Framework, Diffusers, vLLM, NIM)
- Your README should only document **cookbook-specific** dependencies beyond the shared setup
- All dependencies must be installable via `uv pip install` or `apt-get` — no manual builds
- Pin specific versions of critical packages when they affect reproducibility

### 4. One-Click Runnable

- Each notebook should run **top-to-bottom without manual intervention**
- Use environment variables for configurable paths (`HF_TOKEN`, `COSMOS3_MEDIA_ROOT`, etc.)
- Default to the smallest model size (Cosmos3-Nano) so the widest set of GPUs can run it
- If a cookbook requires a running server (vLLM, NIM), provide the exact launch command in the README and automate the health check in the notebook

### 5. Naming Convention

Follow the existing pattern:

```
run_<task>_with_<backend>.ipynb
```

Examples:
- `run_with_vllm.ipynb` — generic Reasoner inference via vLLM
- `run_fd_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb` — forward dynamics via Cosmos Framework
- `run_video_transfer_with_cosmos_framework.ipynb` — video transfer via Cosmos Framework

For markdown-only guides (no notebook): `run_<task>_with_<backend>.md`

## Cookbook README Template

Each cookbook directory needs a `README.md`. Use this structure:

```markdown
# [Cookbook Title]

One-paragraph description of what this cookbook demonstrates and why it matters.

## What You'll Build

- Bullet list of concrete outputs (e.g., "Generate a 480p video from a text prompt")

## Prerequisites

- Link to [shared setup](../README.md#backend-name) for backend installation
- Any additional cookbook-specific requirements

## Backends

| Backend | Notebook | GPU Requirement |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| vLLM    | [`run_with_vllm.ipynb`](run_with_vllm.ipynb) | 1× A100 (80 GB) |
| NIM     | [`run_with_nim.ipynb`](run_with_nim.ipynb) | 1× A100 (80 GB) |

## Quick Start

Minimal steps to go from clone to first result:

    1. Set up the backend (link)
    2. Run the notebook
    3. Check your outputs in `assets/`

## Results / Expected Output

Sample outputs, metrics, and timing benchmarks from a successful run.

## Dataset

| Name | Source | License | Size |
|------|--------|---------|------|
| Dataset Name | [HuggingFace link](...) | Apache 2.0 | ~2 GB |
```

---

## Contribution Areas

We welcome contributions in these areas:

| Area | Examples |
|------|---------|
| **New cookbooks** | Domain-specific applications (robotics, AV, healthcare, manufacturing) |
| **New backends** | Additional serving/inference backends for existing cookbooks |
| **Documentation** | README improvements, prompt guides, architecture explanations |
| **Bug fixes** | Notebook fixes, broken links, version compatibility issues |
| **Benchmarks** | Inference timing across GPU configurations (A100, H100, L40S, RTX 4090) |
| **Post-training recipes** | SFT, LoRA, domain adaptation examples with open datasets |

### What We Won't Merge

- Cookbooks that depend on internal/proprietary datasets
- Notebooks that require manual mid-run intervention
- Changes that break existing cookbook functionality
- Generated binary files (model weights, large media) — use HuggingFace/external links instead

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- CUDA 12.8 or 13.x (see [Troubleshooting](README.md#troubleshooting))
- An NVIDIA GPU with sufficient VRAM for your target workflow
- `uv` >= 0.11.3 ([astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv))
- `git-lfs` installed (`apt-get install git-lfs`)

### Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cosmos.git
cd cosmos
```

Follow [cookbooks/cosmos3/README.md](cookbooks/cosmos3/README.md) to set up the backend(s) your cookbook uses.

### Testing Your Cookbook

Before submitting:

1. **Clean run:** Restart your kernel and run all cells top-to-bottom
2. **Minimal GPU:** Test on the smallest supported GPU configuration
3. **No secrets:** Verify no API keys, tokens, or internal paths are committed
4. **Output cells:** Clear large output cells but keep the Results section outputs
5. **File sizes:** Ensure no single file exceeds 10 MB (use git-lfs for larger assets or link externally)
